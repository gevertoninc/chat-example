# Socket Chat Example

This is a simple project to train web socket implementation

## How to start

- Run `npm i` to install dependencies
- Run `node index.js` to start server

## TODO

Here are some ideas to improve the application:

- Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects
- Add support for nicknames
- Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he/she presses enter
- Add “{user} is typing” functionality
- Show who’s online
- Add private messaging
